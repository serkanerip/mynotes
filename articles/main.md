IDE kullanarak daha hızlı kod yazabileceğimizi ve bizi ilgilendirmeyen gereksiz detaylardan arındırarak asıl işimize kafa yormamızı sağlayacağını anlatan bir makale.

* If you find yourself typing indentation, newlines, space around parens, or anything else 
like that, you are wasting your time.

* Never write variable, method and class declarations just call it where you mean to (perhaps from a test) and then auto-fix to create it.

A computer’s job is to get things precisely correct. Your job is to figure out what to do and convey your intent expressively. You are not a computer. Don’t do its job for it.

If you use an editor instead of an IDE, then you are actively making the choice to waste time. Your editor may manipulate text better than an IDE. It may start up faster. But it can’t manipulate code as quickly as an IDE.

Great programmers use their tools. Some aspects of those tools are more important than others. Attain fluency with those and you will accomplish awesome things with little effort. Start with the Core 6 Refactorings + 3 handy utility operations.

* Instead of building re-usable software, we should try to build disposable software.

* Becoming a professional software developer is accumulating a back-catalogue of regrets and mistakes. You learn nothing from success. It is not that you know what good code looks like, but the scars of bad code are fresh in your mind.

* Good code is just legacy code that doesn’t get in the way. Good code is easy to delete.
